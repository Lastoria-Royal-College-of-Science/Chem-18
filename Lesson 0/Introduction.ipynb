    "\n",
    "In this course, you will learn how to use modern computational tools – particularly the Python programming language – to process, analyze, and display data. As chemists, data is at the heart of your work: it supports your hypotheses, validates your findings, and helps you communicate your results effectively. Being able to process and visualize data clearly is an essential skill for the future of chemical research.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is designed as a self-paced, interactive tutorial. You will work through these Jupyter Notebooks on your own, learning by doing. Many of the concepts will feel familiar, and you'll discover that data processing is not as difficult as it may first seem. Our goal is to make the learning process efficient for both you and us, while giving you practical skills you can apply immediately in your studies and research.\n",

    "A note on grading: this course is offered on a Pass/Fail basis. Your focus should be on exploring, experimenting, and building confidence with the tools – not on chasing points.\n",
