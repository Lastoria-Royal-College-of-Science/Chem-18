This second part, however, is more application-oriented, and the lessons are independent of each other. We've arranged them alphabetically—not as a learning order, but simply to keep track of the order in which they were created. From here on, you are free to choose any lesson to start with( ´▽｀)",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Perhaps all calculations we've done in previous lessons have been done using numerical values. However, in many cases, we want to do calculations using symbols. For example, given the [Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(v) = 4\\pi \\left( \\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T} \\right)^\\frac{3}{2} v^2 e^{-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $v$ the speed of a particle, $m$ the mass of this particle, $T$ the temperature, and $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant. We want to find the most probable speed $v_\\text{mp}$, which is the speed at which the particle is most likely to be at a given temperature. The canonical way to do this is to find the maximum of $f(v)$, and this requires us to evaluate the derivative of $f(v)$ with respect to $v$, and set it to be zero. What if we don't want to do this tedious (_well, it's not quite tedious—you should know it! but I'm lazy..._) calculation? You can use an expensive calculator with CAS (Computer Algebra System) functionality to do this, or you can use software like Mathematica or Maple... These all take a lot of money! Luckily, there is a fantastic library in Python—SymPy—that can carry symbolic mathematics like finding derivatives, and this is what we will study in this lesson.\n",
