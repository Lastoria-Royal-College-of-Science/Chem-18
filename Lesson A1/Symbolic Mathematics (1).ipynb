    "Perhaps all calculations we've done in previous lessons have been done using numerical values. However, in many cases, we want to do calculations using symbols. For example, given the [Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution):\n",

    "$$ f(v) = 4\\pi \\left( \\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T} \\right)^\\frac{3}{2} v^2 e^{-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $v$ the speed of a particle, $m$ the mass of this particle, $T$ the temperature, and $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant. We want to find the most probable speed $v_\\text{mp}$, which is the speed at which the particle is most likely to be at a given temperature. The canonical way to do this is to find the maximum of $f(v)$, and this requires us to evaluate the derivative of $f(v)$ with respect to $v$, and set it to be zero. What if we don't want to do this tedious (_well, it's not quite tedious—you should know it! but I'm lazy..._) calculation? You can use an expensive calculator with **CAS (Computer Algebra System)** functionality to do this, or you can use software like Mathematica or Maple... These all take a lot of money! Luckily, there is a fantastic library in Python: [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/), that can carry symbolic mathematics like finding derivatives, and this is what we will study in this lesson.\n",

    "One thing to be aware of is that numerical integration in SymPy can be quite slow. The `evalf()` and `subs()` methods can provide accurate results with any desired level of precision, but if you value speed over accuracy, especially when working with large datasets, it's better to use another library, such as NumPy or SciPy, to handle these calculations. One way to do this is by using `sp.lambdify()` to convert a SymPy expression into a function that can be evaluated efficiently by numerical libraries, as introduced earlier. For more methods, check the [SymPy documentation on Numerical Computation](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/numeric-computation.html).\n",

    "There are two kinds of equation solvers in SymPy: `sp.solve()` and `sp.solveset()`. The main difference is that `sp.solve()` will provide exact forms of symbolic representations of the solutions, while `sp.solveset()` will provide a set of solutions. They sound similar, but in practice, the result of `sp.solve()` can use the method `subs()` but `sp.solveset()` cannot; also, `sp.solveset()` can provide more than one solution that `sp.solve()` sometimes cannot, especially for periodic solutions.
